    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A very easy idea with a minimum of fuss or muss for any number of people. Individual Baked Eggs surrounded by a strip of bacon, and topped with a square of cheese. These eggs take on a very pleasing flavor just by baking instead of cooking them in the more conventional manner. Great not having splatters all over, and being able to do 12 or more eggs at one time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 slice bacon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon melted butter</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>Â¼ slice Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown, but still flexible. Wrap bacon slice around the inside of a muffin cup. Place a teaspoon of butter (or bacon grease) in the bottom of muffin cup. Drop in egg.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes. Place 1/4 slice of cheese over egg, and continue cooking until cheese is melted and egg is cooked.</li>
    </ol>
